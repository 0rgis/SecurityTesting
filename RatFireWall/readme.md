# API Proxy
This is a Python proxy that intercepts incoming HTTP requests and responses and applies a set of rules to block suspicious traffic. The proxy uses the mitmproxy library to intercept and modify HTTP traffic.

# Usage
To use the proxy, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You also need to install the mitmproxy library by running the following command:

`pip install mitmproxy`

Once you have the mitmproxy library installed, you can run the proxy by executing the proxy.py script:

`python proxy.py`

The proxy will start listening for incoming HTTP traffic on port 8080. To use the proxy, you need to configure your client to use the proxy server. The exact steps for doing this depend on your client application.

# Security Considerations
While this proxy can be useful for blocking suspicious traffic during development and testing, it is not secure enough for use in production environments.

- For example, the current implementation only blocks requests containing <script> tags. However, an attacker could easily circumvent this rule by using a different tag such as <img> with a src attribute that contains malicious code.
- Additionally, an attacker could bypass the user-agent blocking rule by sending a request with a custom header that replaces the user-agent value.
- To make this proxy more secure for production use, you would need to implement more advanced security measures such as input validation, authentication, and encryption.
